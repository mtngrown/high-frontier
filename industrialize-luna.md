## The Mission: Industrialize Luna

This exercise follows Section H9 in the Colonization rules. The
difference is that I'm showing the initial research buildup, and using
different components.

### Year 1

* Operation: income 2, just because. (H1)

### Year 2

* Operation: research: acquire Photon Heliogyro for 0. (H2)

### Year 3

* Operation: sell Photon Heliogyro for 5 WT. (H3)

### Year 4

* Operation: research: acquire Pondermotive VASIMR (H2). What does the Yellow
  signify?

Apparently this thruster is "pushable;" cursory examination of the rules
reveals I don't care about pushability right now. Cost 0. (H2)

### Year 5

* Operation: research: acquire Tungsten Resistojet, cost 0, mass 2. (H2)

### Year 6

* Operation: boost crew, thruster and robonaut to LEO stack; Dry Mass 6.
(H4)


1. Free Action: Cargo Transfer: Form rocket from current LEO stack, mass
   6. Net
   Thrust is 5.
1. Free Action: Fuel up, 5 WT, moves fuel figure (wet mass) to 11, Net
   Thrust: 4.


1. Move: move rocket from LEO, burn 4 to get into HEO. Wet mass 9.

1. Free Action(?): Switch to crew thruster.

1. Free Action: jettison Tungsten Resistojet, Dry Mass now 3, Wet Mass
   6. (D1.5)
1. Free Action: decommission Tungsten Resistojet. (D1.6)


### Year 7

1. Move: land on moon, 1 burn, 8 steps, Wet Mass now 3 & 1/2. (G1)

* Operation: prospect the site, which fails because the Tungsten
Resistojet has ISRU 3, and there are only two hydrations. Bummer. (H6)

If we ditch the robonaut, we can get to DM 1, WM 1 & 3/7, not enough to
boost. So we need to mine fuel in-situ, which is an operation.

### Year 8

* ISRU for fuel. The ISRU rating of the Tungsten Resistojet is 3. The
yield on Luna is 2. Looks like crew is stranded on Luna: 1 + 2 - 3 = 0.

No fuel for you! (H5)

Ok, that was interesting. I think I'm getting a feeling why this game
could get very addictive very quickly.
